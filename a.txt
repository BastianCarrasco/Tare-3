MADAME BOVARY

By Gustave Flaubert

Translated from the French by Eleanor Marx-Aveling


To Marie-Antoine-Jules Senard Member of the Paris Bar, Ex-President
of the National Assembly, and Former Minister of the Interior Dear and
Illustrious Friend, Permit me to inscribe your name at the head of this
book, and above its dedication; for it is to you, before all, that I
owe its publication. Reading over your magnificent defence, my work has
acquired for myself, as it were, an unexpected authority.

Accept, then, here, the homage of my gratitude, which, how great soever
it is, will never attain the height of your eloquence and your devotion.

Gustave Flaubert Paris, 12 April 1857




MADAME BOVARY




Part I



Chapter One

We were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a "new
fellow," not wearing the school uniform, and a school servant carrying a
large desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every one rose as if
just surprised at his work.

The head-master made a sign to us to sit down. Then, turning to the
class-master, he said to him in a low voice--

"Monsieur Roger, here is a pupil whom I recommend to your care; he'll be
in the second. If his work and conduct are satisfactory, he will go into
one of the upper classes, as becomes his age."
